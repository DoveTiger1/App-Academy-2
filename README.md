# App Academy Open

## What is App Academy Open? 

App Academy Open is identical to App Academy's in-person full-time software engineering curriculum. It covers ~1500 hours of material including fundamentals such as data structures and algorithms, design patterns, scalability, OOP, TDD, computational complexity, and software engineering best practices. Programming languages and technologies include Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React-Redux, SQL, Git, HTML and CSS. 

These are all the solutions to all the problems that i went through. App Academy released a new and updated version of this Bootcamp in 2022, so i stopped doing this one as i was pretty busy with other stuff and this one was already pretty outdated.
