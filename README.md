# App Academy Open

## What is App Academy Open? 

App Academy Open is identical to App Academy's in-person full-time software engineering curriculum. It covers ~1500 hours of material including fundamentals such as data structures and algorithms, design patterns, scalability, OOP, TDD, computational complexity, and software engineering best practices. Programming languages and technologies include Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React-Redux, SQL, Git, HTML and CSS. 

I am currently going through the curriculum while doing a bachelor's in Computer Science at UNICAP, so it may take a little longer than the estimated ~1500 hours
